"""Arch_Lab main module ("controller"). Run this as a script or import and
run main().

All functions are interactive and probably should not be run directly (only via
main()). Exact behaviour of each function depends on interface ("view") and
engine ("model") that implement them, but an attempt was made to describe
generally expected behaviour.

'Pending' means that task is not yet done. Finished means that task is done.
